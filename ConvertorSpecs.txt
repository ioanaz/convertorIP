*Let's assume more specs were given*
V1.0 of Convertor:
Let's assume we want to be able to select for what measurement type we want to make a converstion (eg: length)
AND we only want to do one converstion (eg: from m to inch || from km to ni)

V2.0 of Convertor:
We'll be able to convert for all the above measurement units, all types of measurement units (length.metric(mm,cm,m,km) to (length.imperial(inch,feet,mile)) as well as metric to metric, imperial to imperial
Reconvert freshly converted value (eg: x=convert from cm to inch; x= convert same value from inch to nautical mile)

Questions:
Do we want to be able to convert and reconvert?
eg:
length=1km
length.convertToMeters
length.convertToInches

*Use cases*
As a user over Convertor, I want to be able to:
> See what measurement units I can convert so that I give my first conversion command -> Implement Menu
> Select what measurement unit I want to convert so that I can start converting -> HCI low level (cin>>menu nr haha)
> Read option (eg:length)
> Display option for length:
> > mm, cm, m, km
> > in, ft, yd, mi (mile), nmi (nautical mile)
